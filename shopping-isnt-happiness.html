            <h4>Shopping isn't Happiness</h4>

            <p class="font-weight-lighter">Apr 5, 2019</p>

            <p>
              If I wasn’t happy with how my body looked or felt I could blame my
              clothes and just buy more. It came in slowly too so it was subtle,
              a shirt on clearance there and a pair of pants on sale here. All
              to hide from discomfort and pain.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="col-12">
            So I made a few new years resolutions one of which was to not shop
            for at least one month. When I say shop, I mean buying those extras
            I want but I don’t really need if I question myself that fully. It
            wasn’t until I got some distance from "retail therapy" that I
            realized shopping had been my way to cope or even numb out. If I had
            a crappy day it was really easy to aimlessly scroll online stores on
            my phone and not realize that hours had passed by, in my mind it was
            simply window shopping where I eventually always ended up buying
            more things.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>
              If I wasn’t happy with how my body looked or felt I could blame my
              clothes and just buy more.
            </strong>
            <br /><br />
            The hope was the new stuff would then make me feel better not just
            with my body but with everything going on in my world. Don’t get me
            wrong it wasn’t like large packages and hundreds of dollars were
            going out each month but it was the little things like the 4 new
            work out tops that were on sale for $7 so why get just one.
            <br /><br />
            <strong> It came in slowly too so it was subtle. </strong>
            <br /><br />
            I was never hit with my problem head on until that month of
            distance. Looking back it was almost like someone in recover, I had
            to unsubscribe to all the shopping ads I got- distancing myself from
            that old crowd I was hanging around. I would casually flip to an
            online store unconsciously and then catch myself thinking wow what
            just happened. When I noticed these things that’s when I knew I had
            to do this, fully stay the course the entire month, shopping had a
            power over me I never wanted to admit. Which, is mind blowing to me
            since I didn’t grow up in a family that shopped too much in fact I
            had what I needed and a little more but nothing in excess so how did
            I start this all on my own?
            <br /><br />
            <strong> Discomfort and pain </strong>
            <br /><br />
            I had recently lost my grandmother who was my legal guardian and had
            raised me my entire life, acting as mother, father and best friend.
            Looking back I can see the shopping took on a high point when I was
            sitting in the numbness of my grief and I was searching for any
            ounce of happiness (serotonin) but all I was giving myself was the
            unsatisfying short lived hit of dopamine from my instant clocks and
            buys. But this was all a way to not feel that visceral hole in my
            chest from grief, it was a short lived distraction.
            <br /><br />
            <strong> Shame </strong>
            <br /><br />
            Then when the shopping spree arrived at my house, I would feel shame
            and guilt around shopping when I didn’t really need it. I would feel
            worse about my body if things didn’t fit right and I found myself
            trying to hide the shopping from my partner. I felt that ashamed to
            hide the shopping but yet I didn’t stop to think who or what was
            really in control here, probably because shopping is a socially
            acceptable way to cope.
            <br /><br />
            <strong> Distance </strong>
            <br /><br />
            With that distance I gained from challenging myself to a month of
            not shopping for anything other than groceries and pet supplies, I
            began to realize that shopping was more in control than I was. My
            mind/ego whatever you prefer to call it had gone haywire, looking
            for short lived happiness and constantly comparing myself to others
            to make me think I needed this lip product or that top to feel
            beautiful or happy. That distance shed a lot of light for me and now
            it is something that I want to make a norm in my life to keep my
            accountable and to make sure I am not slipping into old patterns. So
            again I have made April a no shopping month for me and instead I
            have decided to pamper myself by getting services like my nails done
            or hair. Other things that make me feel good but aren’t as
            temporary.
            <br /><br />
            <strong> I am overwhelmed by my closet now. </strong>
            <br /><br />
            I have become uncomfortably bothered by the amount of clothes and
            shoes in my closet. It is to a point where I now feel overwhelmed
            since I know it isn’t even possible for me to wear that much stuff.
            So in the air of Marie Kondo I have started getting rid of so many
            things. My own way of reflecting on items is how do I feel when I
            wear this, for many items I remember feel self conscious or
            uncomfortable in items so those are going and I am only keeping the
            things that make me feel comfortable and confident when I wear them.
            That mean a lot of my cheaper fashion is going out the door and I am
            saving the space for high quality items and just less of everything
            like camis, I had 5 white and 5 black camis, I can only wear one at
            a time so that has now gone to one of each. My next mountain is my
            love for gray sweaters, I don’t really need the 7 different gray
            sweaters I own that are overly similar to one another.
            <br /><br />
            <strong> Your turn. </strong>
            <br /><br />
            So now I encourage you to take the time to think about your own
            shopping habits, is shopping coping for you? Is it keeping you from
            feeling your own pain? Are you feeling ashamed about your spending
            habits or the amount of stuff you have? If so or if you just want to
            gain some new awareness of your habits I encourage you to take a
            month away from shopping, only buying your essentials that you need.
