            <p>
              Confidence isn’t an air of arrogance. Peace doesn’t have to be
              doing meditation everyday. Environments and people can shake this
              confidence and peace with who we are. So how do we get back to
              that confidence and that feeling of peace with who we are when we
              are not in an environment conducive to it from 8-5? Find your
              peace with who you are and bring out your true self, your true
              confidence, let your light shine through for us all to see.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="col-12">
            Reflecting back there have been moments throughout my life where I
            believed if I looked this way or dressed that way I would be
            confident. If I only had that carrot I was dangling in front of
            myself to achieve the confidence I wanted, to not feel so unsure of
            myself.
            <br /><br />
            <strong> Confidence isn’t an air of arrogance. </strong>
            <br /><br />
            Like I once believed those people who had that confidence thing also
            must be arrogant, yeah sometimes that can be but that does not mean
            everyone. The people I have been surrounding myself with now and the
            media I am now consuming is people who are confident and what that
            confidence looks like is peace with who they are.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>
              Peace doesn’t have to be doing meditation everyday.
            </strong>
            <br /><br />
            Being at peace with who we are looks different for everyone. For
            example I notice myself being truly at peace with myself when I do
            things that bring me joy with others and on my own, sometimes this
            is journaling with a cup of tea other times it is being fully
            present with who I am around, enjoying myself so much to the point
            where I am completely out of my own head. Even the creation of this
            website was done with that peace, it was inspiring, fun and joyful.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>
              Environments and people can shake this confidence and peace with
              who we are.
            </strong>
            <br /><br />
            I notice myself having an ick reaction when I walk away from some
            environments like the ones where there is this competitive nature or
            overly controlling or where there is this arrogance. It just doesn’t
            put me at peace with who I am and it shakes my confidence, it makes
            me doubt myself even in moments where I shouldn’t. I am human and of
            course I respond to my environment, I try really dang hard for that
            response to be true to me but sometimes it is a reaction.
            Unfortunately there are a lot of systems like this for instance I
            think of grad school and some of the peers I was around it very much
            felt like this constant competition and if you weren’t comparing
            yourself than someone would outright do it for you, yuck. Not the
            best place for wellness and I also notice it happening in careers
            too especially for millennials (which I am one too) in conversations
            with friends in different fields and my own experience in the work
            force I know I am not alone in this. Millennials want to measure up
            to others and sometimes that is at a detriment to themselves and
            others.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>
              So how do we get back to that confidence and that feeling of peace
              with who we are when we are not in an environment conducive to it
              from 8-5?
            </strong>
            <br /><br />
            This is a question I have been asking myself and it is sooo much
            easier said than done. A big piece for me is I have made a soft rule
            at home to not talk about work, I say soft because there are some
            moments where shit has hit the fan and I need my partner to lean on.
            Another thing I have done is found my safe people that we raise each
            other up and inspire each other in the process. Most of these people
            are actually not anyone I actually work with they are my kick ass
            friends who are doing out of the box things that are inspired
            actions. We get re-energized off of each others energies and are
            able to see bigger picture instead of getting stuck in this one
            interaction that shook our peace and confidence - don’t get me wrong
            we still take the time to vent about that but we help get each other
            back on track too. Last but not least, self care - doing as much as
            I can to bring me joy to use the creativity, fun and ease that
            inspire me. For me self care is all about asking myself what sounds
            comforting and enjoyable to me right now in this moment from that
            this is how this website got created it was fun and I got to use my
            creativity that has been yearning to come out, other times it may be
            as simple as stretching or walking my dog.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>
              Find your peace with who you are and bring out your true self,
              your true confidence, let your light shine through for us all to
              see.
            </strong>
            <br /><br />
            Do what fits for you, do what you need, these are just examples of
            what has worked for me but I would be curious how you get back to
            your confidence when it waivers?
