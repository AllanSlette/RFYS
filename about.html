              Me too. I’ve gotten burnt out in jobs, surrounded myself in
              unfulfilling friendships- got burned or was left feeling alone in
              said friendships, lost myself in toxic relationships and looked
              for love in the wrong ways, moved half way across the country on
              my own without a support system, pushed myself to be “perfect”
              only to find that acceptance from others wasn’t what I needed, got
              in over my head with student loans, became a licensed professional
              counselor with a PhD, lost my parents and learned more about
              myself than ever before through the grieving process, realized in
              this process who I want to lean on and now call family, bought my
              first home, have been in the longest relationship I have ever had,
              and started my own business.

              <strong>I get it. I’ve felt that way too.</strong>
              <br /><br />
              My name is Megan Little, a licensed professional counselor with a
              PhD in counselor education and supervision. I help high achieving
              woman who have experienced adverse life events who are feeling
              stuck in the stories they tell themselves but want to get out of
              that cycle, they want to have compassion for themselves and accept
              themselves.
              <br /><br />
              <strong
                >I know what it feels like to feel stuck in our stories that we
                have given ourselves and others have given us, to feel like
                something indescribable is holding you back from your dream
                life.</strong
              >
              <br /><br />
              I have realized it isn’t just my education and experience as a
              therapist that makes my professional lens, it is all of the life
              experiences along the way too. That lead me to my passion of
              <br /><br />
              <strong
                >Working with women who have experienced adverse life events,
                sexual assault survivors, and relationship distress.</strong
              >
              <br /><br />
              All of this has lead to my empowering focused approach to therapy
              to help my clients as they navigate these challenges. I help my
              clients overcome narrations and self sabotaging beliefs that are
              leaving them stuck in the same cycle to create a balanced and
              rewarding life where they realize their own worth.

              <strong>Hear it from them.</strong>
              <br /><br />
              I received permission from some client’s to share their
              experiences working with me so you can get a better idea of what
              that might be like. Read their comments below.

              <strong>Life is hard.</strong>
              <br /><br />
              Like, really hard. And you're doing all the right things; but you
              still feel anxious. You can't seem to stop overthinking
              everything. You are feeling more and more insecure and are worried
              about feeling like a burden to others. You've tried to rationalize
              your thinking, but aren't getting anywhere. And now, that inner
              critic has become so loud and so present, that it's hard to hear
              or believe anything else.
              <br /><br />
              <strong
                >This is what I often hear from clients, and I get it - I've
                been there too. I understand what it's like to be labelled as
                "sensitive" and viewing emotions as a weakness. It's hard to
                figure out how to feel confident in who you are while living up
                to others' expectations. To feel constantly worried about "doing
                the right thing" and struggling with feeling "selfish" when
                you're trying to set boundaries.</strong

              I help those who are excessively worried, struggling with low
              self-esteem, and experiencing relational distress gain confidence
              in being their authentic selves. I help my clients learn how to
              cope with their emotional experiences while practicing
              self-compassion. Emotions are not our enemy; in fact, emotions
              have a purpose. Utilizing evidence-based practices such as
              cognitive-behavioral therapy, dialectical behavior therapy and
              mindfulness - I help clients learn how to use their emotions to
              connect with their inner selves and identify patterns and themes
              that wreak havoc in their lives.

              “Strength when I doubted myself”
              <br /><br />
              “You truly have helped me get over a very challenging few months.
              Being here in a new place, with few people I trust deeply, I felt
              like I would never have the voice to be honest, even when that’s
              what I needed. You helped me find my strength when I wasn’t sure
              if I had any left!”

              “Counseling had really made me a more functional person”
              <br /><br />
              “Now a year later, I feel like a completely different person. I no
              longer feel the need to see a counselor on a regular basis. I
              haven’t had a panic attack in over a year!!! and I feel so much
              more comfortable in my own skin. Every counseling session with you
              had a huge impact on my week, and I feel confident that without
              meeting you I would be no where near where I am today. You have
              such an amazing gift and I’m so glad that your career path lets
              you share it with other people.”
              <br /><br />
              “Thank you again for helping me, for watching me bawl my eyes out
              and for making me feel like my anxiety was something I could
              conquer.”
